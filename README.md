# A weakly supervised framework for high resolution crop yield forecasts

## Naive Trend Model for NUTS2 to NUTS3 Disaggregation
The notebook `dl_weak_supervision.ipynb` includes evaluation of the naive trend model.

## NUTS3 Trend Model and GBDT Model
The NUTS3 models that use NUTS3 yield data are implemented in `mloptimized_combo.ipynb`.

## Test Environment
Google Colab environment or Microsoft Azure Databricks can be used to run
the Jupiter notebook version of the implementation.
